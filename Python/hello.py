# x="te\n\nst"
# print x

# x="test\t\ttest"

# b="I am ham"
# b.join("m")
# '''how do you get the join and split method to work'''
# print (b)

# a=2.23 + float(14)
# print a 

# THIS IS WHERE YOU BEGIN THE PASTING

# DONT UNDERSTAND WHY SECOND PRINT IS 500  GOT IT
# b = 500
# print(b)
# def a():
#     b = 300
#     print(b)
# print(b)
# a()
# print(b)  


# WHY WONT THIS PRINT!!! //now it will
# def a(b,c):
#     return b+c
# # had return 10 here <-- which was blocking the print
# print(a(3,5))

#  GOT IT
# def a():
#     print(1)
#     b()
#     print(2)
# def b():
#     print(3)
# a()
