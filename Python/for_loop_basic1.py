# this is correct

# this is correct
# for i in range(1,100):
#     if (i%5 == 0):
#         print i, "Coding"
#     if (i%10 == 0):

# HOW TO PRINT EVEN INTEGERS?
# THIS PROBLEM ASK TO PRINT TO 500000 BUT I CANT RIGHT??
# for i in range(1,500000,2):
#     print i

# for j in range(2018,1,-4):
#     print j





# this IS NOT RIGHT!! THEY WANTED ME TO JUST COPY AND PRINT IT
def a(b,c):
    print(b+c)
print(a(1,2) + a(2,3))

# this IS NOT RIGHT!! THEY WANTED ME TO JUST COPY AND PRINT IT GOT IT
# b = 500
# print(str(b) + "1")
# def a():
#     b = 300
    # whenthis function is called its 300 and is called third
#     print(str(b) + "2")
# print(str(b) + "3")
# a()
# print(str(b) + "4")  
# ^^--this is the global b



# def a(b,c):
#     if b<c:
#         return 7
#     else:
#         return 14
#     return 3
# print(a(2,3))
# print(a(5,3))
# print(a(2,3) + a(5,3))
